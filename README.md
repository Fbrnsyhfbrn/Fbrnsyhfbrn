**Hi, I’m Hanafi Febriansyah.**  
But this space isn’t about my name — it’s about _doing_, _breaking_, and _rebuilding_ things in silence.

This repository hosts the trail of experiments I’ve done around:

- ⚙️ **Android Open Source Project**: syncing, patching, scripting.
- 🔧 **IT Support Fundamentals**: diagnostics, Linux maintenance, log analysis.
- 🔍 **Reverse engineering**: observing without bias, decoding without ego.
- 🛠 **Shell & Automation**: making boring things vanish in one-liners.
- 🎮 **Terminal-based Games & Interfaces**: because even a console deserves play.

### 🌐 [My Visual Workspace → febrianporto.framer.wiki](https://febrianporto.framer.wiki)

That page is the lens to my thoughts, the canvas to my experiments.

### 🎞️ Motion Playground (coming soon)

If you're reading this in a terminal that supports animation (like `glow`), you might feel some life in the lines. If not — imagine.  
Soon: custom ASCII UI tools, a loading game, and more weird CLI interfaces.

### 💭 Philosophy

Not everything has to wear a name.  
Sometimes, the best work is invisible, reproducible, and free of ego.

> Or maybe just `cd` around, touch a few thoughts, and `cat` your own future.
